        <p>I like reading books because it is a great freetime hobby.<br> I like reading books that are adventurous and books that have mystery.<br>
            I like fiction books and non-fiction books too, and sometimes I read fanfiction on apps.<br>My favourite books series are Tiara Friends and Harry Potter<br>I only have the first two of of the four of the Tiara Friend bokks but i have all the Harry Potter books.<br>Some non-fiction books i have and like include:<br>"Maxwell 365 amazing facts" and space books published by Visual Explorers and just space facts books in general.<br>Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which should be practised by everyone <br>Reading is a great source of enjoyment,knowledge,inspiration and instruction.<br>

        <p> My insparation is probably my family or just the people i watch on youtube. <br> My parents helped me become who I am today and prevented me from doing wrong things and helped me do ten right things.<br> The gachatubers(people with youtube channels uploading gacha stuff) also inspired me to make gacha content too.<br> Yeah so props to them! :D </p>
